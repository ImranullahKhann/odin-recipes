    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.
        </li>
        <li>Sugar: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.
        </li>
        <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.
        </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.
        </li>
        <li>Buttermilk: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.
        </li>
        <li>Butter: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor and shine.
        </li>
